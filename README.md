# Image-Clear
This project clears all obstructions found in PPM images and generates a clear PPM using advanced decision making algorithms. 

### To compile and Run Code:
  1. Download and move all Birds 1-17.ppm files to the main directory. 
  2. Run the following commands:
     ```sh
      javac Blur.java
      ```
      ```sh
       java Blur
      ```
   3. Your Terminal Output:
        ```sh
        Opening birds1.ppm
        Opening birds2.ppm
        Opening birds3.ppm
        Opening birds4.ppm
